	<p>We helped found the <a href="https://cwds.ca.gov/">California Child Welfare Digital Service</a>, California's first Digital Service, and  California's State government transform digital delivery.</p>

	<p>Now we're working with others to do the same.</p>

		<h2>You don't want strategy, but you need it. Here's why.</h2>

		<p>You want a product director or product manager. Or a design director. Or a program manager. You don't want "strategy".</p>

		<p>Nope. You need a strategist, too. Because we solve the problems you have, and get you the answers you need.</p>

		<p>We're your backup for leading and your backup for doing.</p>
		
		<p>We make plans clear, easy to read and great at persuading.</p>
			
		<p>We ask the dumb questions when nobody else can or will.</p>
		
		We help turn bad ideas and directions into great ones. 
		
		We make what's important actually important, what everyone wants to do, actually get done. 
		
		<p>We extricate from ruts, we bring down walls.</p>
		
		<p>If you're in an IT prison, we run a jailbreak and get you started solving business problems.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://verylittlegravitas.com/you-need-strategy/">We do all this, and more.</a></p>

		<p>How do we do this? We do it with <em>very little gravitas</em>. We don't bullshit. We don't hide things. We tell you the truth, but we don't blame. To move forward, you need to know where you really are.</p>

		<p>If this sounds like what you need, if this sounds the slightest bit intriguing, transgressive or just on the right side of acceptable <em>blow-shit-up</em>, then  <a href="mailto:get@verylittlegravitas.com">get@verylittlegravitas.com</a>.</p>

			<p>Hi Questions and Answers,</p>
